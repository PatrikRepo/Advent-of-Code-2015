My solutions for Advent of Code 2015. Written in C++, input files not submitted. All days compatible with C++11, but Day4 uses libssl-dev. 
Compiled with GCC, recommended to set -O3.
I guess that many tasks were more challenging back in 2015, because some B tasks seemed a bit to easy to just re-use the same solution as in A. I guess that modern computers win again.
